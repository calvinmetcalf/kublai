I was going to go with a name in the style of tilecache and tilestash, something like tilebank or tilehoard, but then fuckit, I named it after my cat. 

it works and so far has couchdb caching

the idea is this should work on openshift, but it works on c9 which runs on openshifft but not on openshift itself due to issues with node-sqlite3, after I removed mbtile support [it works](http://kublai-cwm.rhcloud.com/stamenRoads/preview)
