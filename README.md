I was going to go with a name in the style of tilecache and tilestash, something like tilebank or tilehoard, but then fuckit, I named it after my cat. 

it works but going to need some sort of cacheing mechinism

the idea is this should work on openshift, but it works on c9 which runs on openshifft but not on openshift itself, though you might be able to view it on [c9](http://kublai.calvinmetcalf.c9.io/osm-mpo/preview)
